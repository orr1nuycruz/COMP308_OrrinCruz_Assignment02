              I attended Centennial College for three years to study Software
              Engineering Technology. The experience I gained from there lead to
              what I am today. I am a humble person, able to put in the work that
              is given to me. I work very well with peers by contributing in
              giving ideas or assisting them in various tasks in the field. I am
              very excited to be able to share my ideas and to work with more
              people so we can make a great contribution towards society.
